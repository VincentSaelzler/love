## Shuttle Schedule Details

*2019-08-08*

### Coming to the Wedding

**Don’t miss your chance to ride the shuttle!**

The shuttle will begin running at 3:00 PM on Saturday. It will complete one round trip approximately every 25 minutes. The last shuttle will leave the hotel at 4:30 PM.

It can take 14 people each trip. If everyone waits until the last shuttle, there won’t be enough room. We encourage you to ride one of the earlier shuttles, then hang out in the tasting room of the vineyard.

### Leaving for the Night

**At the end of the night, no one will be left behind!**

The shuttle will run as many times as it takes to get everyone back to the hotel.

## Friday Festivities – Don’t Miss Out!

*2019-07-31*

We would love to see **everyone** on Friday August 9th, for the cocktail reception at 7:00 PM!

No RSVP required. Requested attire is smart casual (e.g. Khaki’s and a Polo)

This will be a chance for everyone to meet each other and chat in a more casual setting. It’s also Vincent’s birthday!

It’s at the same venue as the wedding, Dennis Vineyards.

We will be serving beer, wine, and some light appetizers.

Hope to see you there!

## Ten Days to Go

*2019-07-31*

We are so excited for the wedding, and we can barely believe that there are less than 10 days to go now!
